# Note_Detection
Script to identify notes and generate sheet music based on Gabor Transforms (a sub-type of of Short Time Fourier Transforms) in order to decode guitar music. An example guitar song is included in this repo, but in theory the Gabor envelope could be modified to fit any kind of music! Written in python, in notebook format so should be easily runnable in Jupyter or Colab.
